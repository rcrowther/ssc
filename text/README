Sake (with SSC)
---------------
Will probably run any any post Java 7. Theres nothing special, and no dependancies, unless testing (Scalatest).



Tools
-----
Two tools,

- sake  A half-developed but usable tasking/Make tool
- ssc   The scala documenter



Compiling
---------
Both tools are compiled in the same way. The instructions should be in a text file with this file, called INSTALL.


Installation
------------
The bin contains a script for running Sake and ssc. This needs to be pointed at Scala and Sake jars.


Release
-------
The Sake jar should be in /lib, where it will be placed by following the instructions in README and running the included script. 

Scala .jar paths may need to be set, depends on how fully Scala is installed on the host system.

If you use the code for any time, add the full path of the `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

ssc -help

sake -help

should show a lot, as will scaladoc.



Useful Note: commandline format
---------------------------------

SSC commands have this format/usage,

    ssc <switches> <task>

Every modification is a switch, even destinations. To send documentation to different folder (overriding the default and any `build.ssc` modifications),

    ssc -docDir docs/myDifferentlyNamedDocFolder doc

not,

    ssc doc docs/myDifferentlyNamedDocFolder

This explains all usage.
