Testing file utilities is someething I do not understand for cleanliness.

The fixture (object data to test) is the folder stack,

TestFolder
├── test1
├── test2
├── test3 -> TestFolder2/
└── TestFolder2
    └── test3

The symlink is for testing symlink following. When symlinks are not followed, traversals should not repeat TestFolder2 and it's contents.
