This is the documentation for Sake and SSC.

== Package structure ==

The [[sake]] package is a base package. It runs automation scripts, like the Rake utility written in Ruby. But stupider and slower to launch.

The [[ssc]] package is a script built in sake. It's for leveraging Scaladoc documentation, without driving you cross-eyed.

== Automatic imports ==

There is some information, and some tutorial material, in the `README` files in each package. There is also comprehensive Scaladoc.
