== TODO
And debug compiles?

defend ssc on nothing:
ssc.ParseCommandLine.parse(ParseCommandLine.scala:45)
	at ssc.Runner$.main(Runner.scala:340)
	at ssc.Runner.main(Runner.scala)

find can do more than it says...


Scalatest gets lost in this circumstance?
Maybe a warning and block?

"scalaSrcDir is test"?
"'scalaTest' 'compile sources' request has no classes to work from, is forcing compile...
"
"'scalaTest' 'compile test' request has no classes to work from, is forcing compile...
"
Yes it does? It works if the test is repeated, but new material fools it?
Test seems to have problems incrementally recompiling? It's the incremental
test compile which is failing to find it's old gear?

"ssc -case -text CLPa -verbose find" is throwing error, ""-i" not found"
Also, when nothing found, getting error back?

Fail behaviour of tasks:
[done] find
[exception] run
[] bytecode
[] introspect
[defended] tree
[] compile
[] test
[] doc
[] jar

Dim the text, somehow

Select groups in -config.

bubble. Because I'm bored.

Guess package names for 'run'.

srcClean would be nice

Stop warning if there's no config file at all.

Fix tests!

Script runner and ssc build
catch errors

errors should go to stderr? Surely?


Should overall verify input files for multiple/type input too?

Should allow default classes to have spacing?

when running, hunt for packages?


protect against pre/post slashes in user-configured paths?

sake should have a nice message if there is no temp dir?
